### Hi there 👋

I am Raphaël, a junior 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐒𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭 💻 with a background in 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐬𝐬 and 𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧.

🩺 My skills allow me to formulate, implement and present practical solutions to technical and business problems with data.

🧠 I leverage data through 𝐦𝐚𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 and 𝐝𝐞𝐞𝐩 𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 algorithms in a 𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 and 𝐮𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 mode. 

📈 I also 𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐳𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 with  𝐚𝐝𝐯𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐝 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐬 and provide 𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐝𝐚𝐬𝐡𝐛𝐨𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐬 to 𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞 and 𝐠𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐩 𝐚𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐜𝐤𝐥𝐲.

🪜 𝐈 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐛𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐯𝐨𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐲 𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐩 𝐨𝐟 𝐚 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐬𝐜𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞 project implementation, from 𝐝𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐜𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐧𝐠𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠, and 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 🔨 to the 𝐝𝐞𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 of trained algorithms 𝐨𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐥𝐨𝐮𝐝 🚀, passing by the 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐨𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧, and 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐨𝐟 𝐚𝐥𝐠𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐦𝐬 ⚗️.
